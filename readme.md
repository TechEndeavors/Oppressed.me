## Oppressed.me

Oppressed.me is a directory of hackers imprisoned with the simple purpose of attempting to provide them regular contact and educational
materials. This will keep their skills and minds sharp as well as provide important emotional support for individuals greatly out of their
element. 

This project is made in Laravel 5 but is very much a work in progress.
